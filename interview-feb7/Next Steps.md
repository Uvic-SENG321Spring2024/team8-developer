## Interview Summary

Issue 19/20:
- Rewrite Business Opportunity, Business Objectives, and Success Metrics so they have distinct purpose
- Opportunity should be high level goal with reasoning
- Objectives should be quantified, and are an extension of goals/opportunity
   - Include: employee engagement, customer satisfaction, reduced payroll errors
   - Don't include: cost 
- Success Metrics are smaller milestones that are also quantified

Issue 22: 
- Remove the term "centralized"
- Features should be actions that can be taken
    - Ensure all current features are worded as actions, not goals
- Separate "Centralized Communication and Scheduling" because communication and scheduling are separate features

- Include recipe management as a major feature
   - Three levels of access (user classes: managers need view/edit, kitchen need to view, front of house need limited view, delivery driver/bookkeepers no access)

   - All recipes stored indefinetely
   - Two sections, currently served and out of service
