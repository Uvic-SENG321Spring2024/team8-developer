- What scheduling issues are you having with your scheduling system and Quickbooks?
Transferring hours into Quickbooks, current system does not take into account if its a holiday, overtime, sick day, etc.

Manually moving hours into Quickbooks.

- How does your current scheduling software work? How is information shown to employees and what are its limitations?

Manager manually assigns hours in calendar view \
Employee can see by day or week, and see their own or people working same shift \
Only see people you are working with, not on shifts you're not assigned to \
Makes hours unclear to employees

Can do overtime, but must be careful about it
  
- How does your current communication system work with Homebase and Basecamp? What does it do well and what are its limitations?

Similar systems, but used differently \
Basecamp for staff wide announcements and shift leads to update employees (issue with customer, specific updates) \
Homebase for scheduling, group chat for people to say if they can't come in and arrange individually about shifts

How to know employees are reading message on basecamp? Only known if they respond.

Employees tend to only use Homebase because scheduling is very relevant, might not use Basecamp enough to guarentee announcemtns are seen.

- Do you want the new system to interact with the current systems?

Combine homebase and basecamp, centralized communication (group and individual)

Mobile for most, but managers may appreciate desktop view (website)

- What are the factors you will use to define and measure success on the project?

Yes, when employees are not well informed (during launch week first week of month with new flavours) \
Customers do not get what they expect \
Miscommunication results in noticably more negative reviews \
Shortage of staff because not enough responses or employee tries to cover a shift that overlaps with their own and they actually can't
