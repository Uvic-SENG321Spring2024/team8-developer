What scheduling issues are you having with quickbooks
	Main issue is when people are scheduled and transferring hours. There is no system for sick days, stat holiday etc. have to keep track of overtime, holidays outside of system manusally. On Homebase someone needs to manually put hours into quickbooks. Can be a lot of manual errors.
How does current software systems work
	By week manager will manually put each persons hours. Employees can see entire week with alle mpoyees, or just see their hours. Limitaions are you only see people you are working with. If you work Monday Thursday Friday. You only see people working Monday Thursday Friday. Difficult to swap with people as you only see the days you are working.
Can the scheduling system do overtime
	The system wont account for stats
How does current communication system work
	Homebase and basecamp work similiariyl basecamp announces staffwide announcement, gives shift leads of every shift. Keeps everyone in same loop. Homebase is scheduling communication. There is a group chat for trading shifts, can dm other employee. Instagram dms on homebase. Instagram posts are on basecamp. On base camp they try to announce big shifts like ice cream flavors. They need a way for employees to know what to tell the customers about new flaovrs. Want to be able to ensure employees know what to tell customers. No way to confirm who saw the post. As they are separate apps.
How would you want new system to work.
	Keeping track of the kind of hours someone has sick day/stat/regular. Combine the two functionalities of homebase and basecamp. Combine announcements and message capabilities. 
Are you open to replacing homebase and basecamp entirely.
	Yes
Preferred environment?
	Preferably mobile, preferably managers have a desktop app
What measures to define success
	Accurate info is provided to customers, about ingredients from company wide announcements. Improve number of staff reading announcements by 25%, reduce uncovered shifts by 50%. A quicker response time between employee managers and employees. Increase in positibe customer review by 20%, general increase in positive reviews. Want to see interaction with company announcements by employees. Last one Judged by reviews and managers seeing improvements.
Have your customers been negatively effected by problem
When employees are not properly informed there is a noticeable amount of negative reviews of customers not getting what they want. There has been cases of staff shortages or all of a sudden a person tries to come in but they are unavailable due to incorrect info
What would the initial first releace(core value) you want. Scheduling first interpersaonal communication and then company wide communication
What would be nice to have
	Automate hours being put into quickbooks, to get rid of human error.
In rfp you bring up ingredients
	They use basecamp to store ingredient list, and allergens. Front of house can see allergens. Cant see recipe. Carry over old system for having ingredients.
How would this improve onboarding
	Right now to familiarize employees with 2 employees they have to know two apps to work. Having one would be easier.
Do you want the system to send out new schedules
	Yeah
What features do you want added to company wide announcements(files or videos)
	Currently videos, images, bonus is pdf. Embedded in the annoiuncement, text and the image/video
What information do you want hidden from employees.
	No sensitive information shown to other employees. No payroll, no recipes.
What is the difference between each role.
	On a role level, front of house interacts with customers. Kitchen makes ice cream. App wise kithcn should see recipes, front of house shouldn’t. 2 front of house managers, kitchen manager operates all kitchen staff, deal with schedules, role specific information. 
How many managers are at the store at a time.
	Always a kitchen manager there at location with kitchen. House manager works half the time. Always a kitchen manager working, multiple people with role. Occasionally house manager work. Shift lead would be front of house employee with experience. 
Expand on truckers. 
	Only there 2 a week. Move ice cream from lcoaiton with kitchen to other location. Only use app once a week. They are scheduled the same as other staff. They are least effected by app. They still get company wide announcemtnts. Sometimes the staff of the second store they don’t know shipment is coming. Lack of communication regarding when staff is coming.
How do you want the book keeper to interact
	Would be nice to remove manual interaction with quickbooks transferring shift. Most of work is done on quickbooks.
Clarifying scheduling
Does shift start time change
	Shifts can change from 4-6 hours, change number of people on shift depending on season, time
Do you want employees able to see who is working when and where
	Yes option to see only yours and then see everyones
How do paystubes work
	Official one comes from quickbooks, rough one from homebase
What features do managers have in homebase
	Don’t have a ton of info on homebase. For employees its very similar to google calendar.
Do employees work between both locaitons
	Some employees work at both. Only some work at both. It is in their profile. Employees working both locaitons get separate hours for each. Can cause problems for employees who work both as shifts show up on separate calendar.


Add constrain that 70+ people need to be able to access the software
We have an assumption that everyone has a phone
