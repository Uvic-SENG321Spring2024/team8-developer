## Demo

Login and overview of features
- Yes, incorrect password would have an error message

Scheduling
- How would you know which week from the selector? (numbering is weeks of the selected month)
- Type of download for tracked hours (thinking table or csv file)
- Way to see individual days? (Yes, that is part of the plan - not in our user stories)
- How does the scheduling options change for different roles (Manager view in demo, so showed storyboard, front of house staff would have clock in/out, swap shifts, and availability)
- Where are drafts of schedules saved? (Create Schedule flow would pick back up where the draft was saved)

Communication (Messages)

   - How to make unread announcement (even if not newest) be seen
   - Frequency of announcements? Every two weeks

Recipe
