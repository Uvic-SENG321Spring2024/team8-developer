# Interview Questions
---
## Plan
- Prototype walkthrough and keeping track of feedback/reactions (most of section 5)
- Diagram walkthrough? (sections 6, 7, 8, and 9)
- Additional questions about GitHub issues that did not come up in the walkthroughs


## Questions
Issue 68 - Section 5 Scheduling Feature
- RE: storyboard not screenshot of prototype clarification?

Issue 70 - Section 5 Recipe Feature
- RE: add preconditions/user to first storyboard panel?
   - The identified section does have that, but would you prefer a different notation?

Issue 71 - Section 5 Account Feature
- Clarify ACC-9 concern, "The system must automatically log out users once they close the application." being unnecessary and inconvenient.
   - Would you prefer the user is never logged out, or logged out after a period of time with the application closed?
   - Intention was to prevent someone stealing the user's phone and modifying their payment information.
- User Story 5: "if it's general payment info then you're going to need a lot of extra security."
   - What security are you interested in seeing?
 
Issue 77 - Section 6.1 Data Models
- Would you like us to add conditions to relationships to limit which employees are allowed to associated with creating/editing a recipe/announcement/etc?
   - We assumed these would be controlled by business rules/requirements of each feature

Issue 78 - Section 9 Data Flows/Analysis Models
- What does "If I look at an entity, I should see all data flow from the entity without having to refer to another entity?" mean?
- Do bookkeepers and managers need to clock in and out? Our understanding was the managers were paid on salary, and didn't need to clock hours?
