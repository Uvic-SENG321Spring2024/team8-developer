1. **Overview**

      Provide an overview of the sections and contents of the document
2. Business Requirements

   1. **Background**
   Summarize the rationale and context for the new product or for changes to be made to an existing one. 

   2. **Business Opportunity**
   Describe the business problem that is being solved or the process being improved. Describe the needs of typical customers or of the target market. Present customer problems that the new product will address. 

   3. **Business Objectives**
   Summarize the important business benefits the product will provide in a quantitative and measurable way. Organizations generally undertake a project to solve a problem or exploit an opportunity. Business objectives define ways to measure achievement of business goals. 

   4. **Success Metrics**
   Indicators that stakeholders will use to define and measure success on the project. What are the factors that will have the greatest impact on achieving success (i.e., could include aspects within and external to the organization).

   5. **Product Vision Statement**
   Write a concise vision statement that summarizes the long-term purpose and intent of the product.   Describe the context and origin of the product being specified in this RD. For example, state whether this product is a follow-on member of a product family, a replacement for certain existing systems, or a new, self-contained product. If the RD defines a component of a larger system, relate the requirements of the larger system to the functionality of this software and identify interfaces between the two. A simple diagram that shows the major components of the overall system, subsystem interconnections, and external interfaces can be helpful but not required.




3. Scope and Limitations
   1. **Major Features**
      Summarize the major features the product contains or the significant functions that it performs or lets the user perform. Details will be provided in Section 5, so only a high level summary is needed here. Organize the functions to make them understandable to any reader of the RD. Think about how users will use the features to ensure the list is complete. Also ensure that it does not include unnecessary features that sound interesting, but does not provide customer value.     

   2. **Project Scope**
   Provide a short description of the software being specified and its purpose, including relevant benefits, objectives, and goals. Relate the software to corporate goals or business strategies.

   3. **Limitations and Exclusions**

4. **Context Description**




   1. **User Classes and Characteristics**

        Identify the various user classes that you anticipate will use this product. User classes may be differentiated based on frequency of use, subset of product functions used, technical expertise, security or privilege levels, educational level, or experience. Describe the characteristics of each user class. Certain requirements may pertain only to certain user classes. Distinguish the favored user classes from those who are less important to satisfy.

   2. **Operating Environment**

        Describe the environment in which the software will operate, including the hardware platform, operating system and versions, and any other software components or applications with which it must peacefully coexist.


   3. **Design and Implmentation Constraints**

        Describe any items or issues that will limit the options available to the developers. These might include: corporate or regulatory policies; hardware limitations (timing requirements, memory requirements); interfaces to other applications; specific technologies, tools, and databases to be used; parallel operations; language requirements; communications protocols; security considerations; design conventions or programming standards (for example, if the customerâ€™s organization will be responsible for maintaining the delivered software).


   4. **Assumptions and Dependencies**

        List any assumed factors (as opposed to known facts) that could affect the requirements stated in the RD. These could include third-party or commercial components that you plan to use, issues around the development or operating environment, or constraints. The project could be affected if these assumptions are incorrect, are not shared, or change. Also identify any dependencies the project has on external factors, such as software components that you intend to reuse from another project.
   5. **Glossary of Terms**

      Define all the terms necessary to properly interpret the RD, including acronyms and abbreviations.


   6. **References**

      List any other documents or Web addresses to which this RD refers. These may include user interface style guides, contracts, standards, system requirements specifications or use case documents. Provide enough information so that the reader could access a copy of each reference, including title, author, version number, date, and source or location.
