# 2. Business Requirements <a name="requirements"></a>

## i. **Background** <a name="background"></a>
The client, Banter Ice Cream, wants an improvement of the software that they are using for scheduling, communication, and payroll management. Banter's current scheduling system, Homebase, is used at least once per week to check shift schedules, swap shifts, and record time worked. The problem with this current software is it lacks certain features resulting in employees having difficulty switching shifts. A feature missing is the ability for staff to view the available schedules of other employees to find open shifts. Another feature missing results in difficulties in payroll integration with Homebase. Currently the application does not summarize hours which requires bookkeepers to manually calculate regular, holiday, overtime, sick days, and vacation days for each employee. Basecamp is a separate system utilized by Banter Ice Cream to send staff wide announcements and news regarding the company. Having a separate piece of software to receive announcements results in Basecamp being checked infrequently, leading employees to miss messages about new ice cream flavours and ice cream deliveries between locations. Employees missing ice cream flavour announcements lowers customer satisfaction as the provided information about current ice flavours is not accurate. Employees missing messages about scheduled deliveries lowers efficiency as the employees are not prepared to unload the deliveries. The client wants a solution that will make managing finances, swapping shifts, communicating with staff, and onboarding staff easier to accomplish by having one combined app. This conglomeration of their systems will help onboard new staff as less platforms are required to be learned by employees, in addition to all onboarding material being more easily found by all employees.


## ii. **Business Opportunity** <a name="opportunity"></a>
The new system will be a single platform, that combines the functionality of Homebase and Basecamp. Using one platform will improve employee engagement because they will only need to check one application for updates. Using one platform will also reduce onboarding time as new employees only need to learn one system. The new system will improve on the scheduling functionality of Homebase, including features for shift management, swapping shifts, clocking in and out, and calculating hours worked. The scheduling system will reduce scheduling errors due to incorrectly swapped shifts and will reduce payroll errors by summarizing hours according to the client's requests. The new system will also include the communication functionality of Basecamp. The communication system will improve employee knowledge of company updates and increase instances where employees are prepared for planned ice cream deliveries. The new system will also store information about Banter Ice Cream, including onboarding materials and ice cream recipes, so they are available to each employee with access. Both onboarding materials and recipe management will improve employee knowledge of Banter Ice Cream and improve onboarding experience. Improved employee knowledge, improved communication, improved onboarding, and reduced scheduling errors will result a better customer experience and improved customer satisfaction. Overall, the new system shall result in more engaged employees, more satisfied customers, fewer payroll errors, and easier onboarding for new employees.


## iii. **Business Objectives** <a name="objective"></a>

Banter Ice Cream's new system will faciliate business growth through better internal management practices using the new system. The following objectives will all contribute to increased business growth. The methods for measuring these objectives are described in the Success Metrics section.
* Improve employee engagement by 50%.
* Improve customer satisfaction by 25%.
* Reduce time associated with payroll by 25%.
* Reduce manual errors associated with payroll by 50%.
* Reduce time associated with onboarding new employees by 25%.

The listed objectives shall be achieved within three months of release.


## iv. **Success Metrics** <a name="success"></a>

The following metrics will be used to measure the success of the system.

**Announcement Visibility**
      
- Within 3 months of release, staff's interactions with the announcements are increased by 50%. This will be measured by the number of replies, reactions, and further questions to the managers.
      
**Customer Satisfaction**
      
- In 3 months of release, the Google reviews average score would increase by 0.5 stars in its scale of 1 to 5.
- By 6 months, the Google reviews average score would increase by 1.0 star. 

**Bookkeeping Efficiency**
   
- In 3 months of system's release, bookkeepers will spend 25% less time during each payroll period.
- After 6 months of release, manual errors associated with payroll would reduce by 50%.

**Onboarding New Employees**

- Within 3 months of release, new staff should take 25% less time to familiarize themselves with the system during onboarding.


## v. **Product Vision Statement** <a name="vision"></a>
The new system intends to improve communication between staff at Banter Ice Cream. This will be accomplished by reducing scheduling confusion, minimize time spent manually calculating hours, and ensuring relevant information is passed to employees. This will be done by combining the systems that are currently used, Homebase and Basecamp; with additional features to improve the client's integration with Quickbooks. The goal of this product is to increase employee engagement with the system, streamline the creation of staff schedules, improve finance management, and improve customer satisfaction by providing accurate and up to date information.

# 3. Scope and Limitations <a name="scope"></a>

## i. **Major Features** <a name="features"></a>

To ensure Banter Ice Cream's system effectively meets the operational needs and improves internal management, the following features will be included.

**Scheduling System:**
   - Create, modify, and manage shifts through a scheduling interface.
   - Employees can swap shifts, subject to managerial approval, to accommodate personal needs while ensuring operational requirements are met.
   - Calendar views for employees and Managers to provide a clear overview of work schedules.
     
**Clock-In and Clock-Out System:**
   - Clock in at the start and clock out at the end of shifts, enabling precise tracking of work hours for all hourly employees.
   - Automatically tracks employee hours, including regular, overtime, sick days, and holidays.
   - Automatically calculate earnings, including overtime.
 
**Recipe Management System:**
   - A recipe management module that allows Managers to create, edit, and archive recipes, including full details and allergen information.
   - Front of house staff will have access to view recipes and allergen information but not the detailed ingredients, ensuring they are informed for customer queries without access to proprietary recipe details.
   - Kitchen staff will have access to full recipe details, including ingredient lists, preparation instructions, and allergen information, to ensure accurate preparation.
   - Historical recipe records, enabling tracking of changes over time and access to previous versions for reference or reintroduction.
  
**Communication and Announcement System:**
   - Embedding capabilities for images, videos, and PDFs in announcements and messages to enrich communication.
   - Ability to send and receive company-wide announcements and communicate about shifts changes.   
      
**Role-Based Access:**
   - Different access levels for managers, bookkeepers, delivery drivers, and staff, as defined in User Classes and Characteristics section of this Requirements Document.
   - Safeguard sensitive information through controlled access, ensuring privacy and security across the system.
   - Tailored interfaces and features depending on the user’s role within the company.   

**Onboarding Material Access:**
   - Grant employees access to a library of onboarding materials, such as instructional videos, directly within the system. 
   - Ability to upload onboarding materials.
  

## ii. **Project Scope** <a name="project-scope"></a>

The software being developed is a comprehensive employee management and communication system designed specifically for Banter Ice Cream. Its purpose is to consolidate existing systems Homebase and Basecamp into one centralized platform that integrates with Quickbooks, improving internal communication, scheduling efficiency, and payroll management. The anticipated benefits include better-informed employees, streamlined shift management, reduced manual errors in payroll, and an overall increase in operational efficiency. This directly aligns with the client's objectives of enhancing customer satisfaction, improving employee engagement, and facilitating business growth through better internal management practices.


## iii. **Limitations and Exclusions** <a name="limitations"></a>

**Quickbooks Integration - (Limitation)**
- Direct integration with Quickbooks was determined to be lower priority. Therefore, we will limit this feature to implementing a summary of hours worked by each employee. The bookkeeper can manually process this summary.

**Desktop View - (Exclusion)**
- The clients have indicated that they only want a mobile application view for the system and that the desktop view is not desired.

**Notifications - (Exclusion)**
- It has been determined with clients that notifications are not a high priority for the system.

**Inventory Management System - (Exclusion)**
- Inventory Management was mentioned as a desired feature, but it does not fit in with the rest of the system requested.

**Automated Data Migration - (Exclusion)**
- Automated Data Migration to the new system may be a difficult feature to implement. It is more practical to do manually since it’s a one-time action that only needs to happen once during onboarding to the new system.
